Investigated unit test frameworks. Tried the integrated cppunittestframework and GTest/GMock. Settled for cppunittestframework in the end since the reason
to use GTest was that there seemed to be some small issues with
using GMock with other test tools than GTest.

There proved to be much extra dependencies / work to be able to use GTest,
so will start with cppunittestframework

To be able to use GTest with Test Explorer, this VS extension is needed:

Also, to get it to work properly, F# runtime is needed:
